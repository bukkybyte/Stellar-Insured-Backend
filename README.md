(NestJS – Stellar Insured Backend API)

Stellar Insured ⚙️ — Backend API

The Stellar Insured backend is a secure and scalable API layer that supports decentralized insurance operations such as policy management, claims processing, DAO governance, oracle verification, and analytics.

Built with NestJS, this backend serves frontend clients, DAO participants, and third-party integrations, while coordinating off-chain logic such as fraud detection and data aggregation—without compromising the trustless nature of Stellar-based smart contracts.

✨ Core Responsibilities

Insurance policy lifecycle management

Claim submission and verification

DAO proposals, voting, and result tracking

Oracle data ingestion

Fraud detection and monitoring

Analytics and reporting APIs

🗂️ Data Model Notes

Insurance is the primary product domain for this service.

The Prisma schema includes insurance models for pools, policies, claims, reinsurance contracts, and audit logs. Legacy project/contribution models remain in place because the Stellar event indexer, reputation scoring, and notification flows still depend on them while the broader data layer is being consolidated.

⚠️ **Error Handling**

All endpoints return standardized error responses. Clients should inspect the
`errorCode` field (see `ERROR_CODES.md`) and present the accompanying
`message` to users. Transient failures are automatically retried by internal
clients and downstream circuits prevent cascading outages.
